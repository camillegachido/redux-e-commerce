## Functionalities
User can:
-Add a product to the shopping cart
-Remove a product from the shopping cart
-Change your profile information (name and address)


## Learning and difficulties
> With the project, I learned redux and react-redux. In addition, the product slider > on sale was 100% with css, without adding external librarys. I also trained the > concepts of clean code and component organization
##### Redux
Redux is a javascript library that allows the centralization of the states and logic (undo / redo) of your application.
##### React-redux
It is the official react bindings for Redux
##### Component organization
I created a concise folder structure, with separation between pages and components. 

### Runnin locally
