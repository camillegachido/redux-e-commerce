## Functionalities
User can:
- Add a product to the shopping cart
- Remove a product from the shopping cart
- Change your profile information (name and address)

<br />

## Used technologies, learning and difficulties
> With the project, I learned redux and react-redux. In addition, the product slider (on sale) was 100% with css, without adding external librarys. I also trained the concepts of react-router-dom, clean code, component organization and markdown (exactly on this page :sweat_smile:)
- **Component organization**: 

   -I created a concise folder structure, with separation between pages, components, routes and store (redux concept)
   
- **Markdown**: 

   -It is a simple markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Markdown converts your text to valid HTML
   
- **React**: 

   -It is an open source JavaScript library focused on creating user interfaces on web pages (front-end)
   
- **Redux**: 

   -It is a javascript library that allows the centralization of the states and logic (undo / redo) of your application
   
- **React-redux**: 

   -It is the official React bindings for Redux
   
- **React-router-dom**: 

   -It is a react library that helps in navigation within the application, I had used and reinforced the Router, Switch, Route and Link concepts
